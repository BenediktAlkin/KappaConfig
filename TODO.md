- test error messages
- navigate to parent with . in interpolation (e.g. ${eval:${vars.total_epochs}-${..[0].max_epoch}})
- maybe remove None nodes
- ${${yaml:optims/common}.mae_pretrain} is not possible (not sure if it should be possible)
  - right now a template is resolved with only the yaml resolver so the interpolation can't be resolved
